# My_Learning_DSA

Repository for "Data structures & Algorithms" - learn code

Competitive Coding will be done in programming languages - `Java`, `Python`, `Rust`, `Typescript`.

## My Notes

- Always prefer key-value based data structures i.e. `map` over `array` based data structures, it has the **fastest read**, but `array` has the **fastest write**. This is because during insertion, the `map` has to find if the key is already present or not, but in `array`, it just has to append the value at the end of the `array`.
